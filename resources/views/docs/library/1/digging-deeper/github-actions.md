# GitHub Actions

You can use the library inside a GitHub workflow.

An [example](https://github.com/PrestaEdit/prestaflow-prestashop) is done here.

## Workflow

You will need to setup a PHP 8.2 version with GD extension.

Also, the needs to create an .env file will be achieved by a specific action.
