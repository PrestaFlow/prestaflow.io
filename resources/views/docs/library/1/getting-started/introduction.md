## Let's Build Together ðŸš€

PrestaFlow is an open-source set of prebuilt tests components, ready-to-use examples made for the PrestaShop E-commerce software.

As now, it's the first library of its kind that lets you write and manage automated tests on your PrestaShop in PHP.


## PHP vs others platform

Initially started in NodeJS, the library caused problems when used in a (future) application after some development time.

Several options were considered, and the one chosen was obvious: a PHP library.

The development of this library aimed to combine two important elements: user understanding and developer enjoyment.

## Open source

The PHP library is open source.

## Presentation

After contributing to PrestaShop SA's modules-testing-library projectâ€”now archivedâ€”at the end of December 2021, the first steps of PrestaFlow were completed two years later.

On January 17, 2024, PrestaFlow became a reality.

Since then, the focus has been on the development of the PHP library.

### First public presentation

The first official presentation of the project was given on the 3th April, 2024 during the [Friends Of Presta Day](https://friendsofpresta.org/friends-of-presta-day-fop-day/).

You can [watch the replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJAhWu8LpKM) on YouTube.
